Custom Node Examples
====================

This directory contains example extension packages for ADKFlow.

Each example is a self-contained package demonstrating different
aspects of the custom node system:

Examples:
---------

uppercase/
    Simple text transformation node (beginner-friendly).
    Demonstrates basic inputs, outputs, and configuration fields.

api_client/
    Full-featured HTTP client (advanced).
    Demonstrates all widget types, conditional visibility, validation,
    lifecycle hooks, multiple ports, helper modules, and more.

To use these as templates:
1. Copy the package directory to your `adkflow_extensions/` directory
2. Rename and modify as needed
3. Reload extensions in ADKFlow
